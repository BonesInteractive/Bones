Note: This is the damage receiver towards an enemy. The issue I was having was that the animation events were saying no receiver because the damagesender script needed to be on the parent (Player game object) with the ANIMATION COMPONENT to work


using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using UnityEngine.AI;

public class DamageReceiver : MonoBehaviour
{
    //[Range(1.0f, 30)]
    public  Slider enemyHealthBar;                       //for slider UI
    //public float enemyHealth;

    Animator anim;

    public string opponentTag;

    public AudioClip enemyDeathSound;

    public NavMeshAgent Kaneebus;

    public Collider enemyCapsule;
    public BoxCollider enemyBox;



    private void Awake()
    {
        anim = GetComponent<Animator>();
    }

    public void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {
       
        if (other.gameObject.tag != opponentTag) return;

        enemyHealthBar.value -= 5;                                             //Main enemy health, lower it is the more health he/she has

        if (enemyHealthBar.value <= 0)
        {
            enemyCapsule.enabled = false;
            enemyBox.enabled = false;
            Kaneebus.GetComponent<NavMeshAgent>().isStopped = true;
            GetComponent<AudioSource>().PlayOneShot(enemyDeathSound, 1);
            anim.SetBool("isDead", true);

        }
    }
}
