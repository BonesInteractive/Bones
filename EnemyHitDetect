NOTE: I used a Slider UI for enemy health value to kill the bastard. Make sure the tags are correct and the enemy isn't hitting himself, that was the issue I was having. 


using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class hittingEnemyDetect : MonoBehaviour
{

    public Slider enemyHealthBar;                       //for slider UI
    Animator anim;

    public string opponent;

    //static public float hitpoint = 20;
    //static public float maxHitpoint = 20;

    //Another way is to use a Slider UI for healthbar UI

    void Start()
    {
        anim = GetComponent<Animator>();
    }

    void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
    {

        if (other.gameObject.tag != opponent) return;  //return will stop running the code below

        enemyHealthBar.value -= 30;                     //if enemy gets hit it will decrease by 20, at 30 three or four hits and enemy is down
        Debug.Log("Hit");

        if (enemyHealthBar.value <= 0)
            anim.SetBool("isDead", true);
            
        Debug.Log("KaneebusIsDead");
    }


        // Update is called once per frame
        void Update()
        {

        }
    }
